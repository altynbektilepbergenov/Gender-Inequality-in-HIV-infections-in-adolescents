# Gender-Inequality-in-HIV-infections-in-adolescents
The data is a subset of UNICEF's 'Key epidemiology indicators for children and adolescents aged 10-19,1990-2019.'

I creathed some visualizations about HIV infection, inferred some useful data 

I was able to identify trend in gender inequality of hiv infections by plotting a graph
